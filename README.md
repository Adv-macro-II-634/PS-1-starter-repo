# ProblemSet1
Problem 3 from section 2.2, but update the tables using data from the SCF 2016 or 2019. Try to follow the [data guide](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) by Gentzkow & Shapiro by automating the data processing steps, keeping files and code organized, and, of course, using Git/GitHub.

Feel free to use or modify the file structure in this repository, which in turn follows G&S's suggestions.

Finally, try not to commit and upload raw data or other large data files to git. While it is a powerful tool to back up and keep track of changes in the files *you* write (that is, programming files), it is not designed to be a tool for data storage. A good way to do this is to exclude data files by adding them to your `.gitiginore` file, for example by adding `*.csv` and `*.dta` there.
