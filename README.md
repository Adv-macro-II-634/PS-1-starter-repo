# ProblemSet1
Do **either** Problem 3 **or** Problem 4 from section 2.2. Try to follow the [data guide](http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) by Gentzkow & Shapiro by automating the data processing steps, keeping files and code organized, and, of course, using Git/GitHub.

Feel free to use or modify the file structure in this repository, which in turn follows G&S's suggestions.
